A summer in the black men hills of Dakota there lived a young boy named Rocky Racoon. Monday has woven round off with another guy hit young Rocky and I. Rocky didn't like that and said "I'm gonna get that boy". So one day he walked into town, booked himself a room in the local saloon. Rocky Racoon checked into his room only to find Gideon's bible. Rocky had come equipped with a gun, to shoot off the lads of his rival. His rival it seems, had broken his dreams, by stealing the girl of his fancy. Her name was Magill and she called herself Nill but everyone knew her as Nancy. Now she and her man, who called himself Dan, were in the next room at the Hoedown. Rocky burst in and reading a grin. He said "Dannyboy this is a showdown". But Danny was hot and he drove fast and shot and Rocky collapsed in the corner. Ahhh. Dadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadaladaladadudelududududuleduduudududelududududududeladelada. Now the doctor came in, stinking of Gin, and proceeded to lie on the table. He said "Rocky you made your match". And Rocky said "Doc., it's only a scratch. And I'll be better, I'll be better doc. as soon as I am able". And now Rocky Racoon, he fell back in his room, only to find Gideon's bible. Gideon checked out, and he left at no doubt to help with good Rocky's revival. Dudedudududududdududududududude. Good Rocky Racoon.
